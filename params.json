Based on consensus, decentralization and rationality, it tries to provide resources to help one understand his/her surroundings\r\n  \r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\n  + One undestands, seeks and appreciates liberty\r\n  + One believes in the modern excess of government\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n  + As an early project, there might be unintended bias coming from early contributors. As it grows, we expect it to go away.\r\n  + This project is currently focused on the reality of western countries(and affected countries). If it doesn't reflect your reality, feel free to fork it and make changes. In order to build a community around it, we'd appreciate to reference it to Libertr.\r\n \r\n## Threats to Liberty\r\n\r\n### War on Privacy\r\n\r\n  + [NSA targets the privacy-conscious](http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/NSA-targets-the-privacy-conscious,nsa230.html)\r\n  + [Privacy is at a crossroads.

Based on consensus, decentralization and rationality, it tries to describe realities and solutions for one's life.\r\n  \r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\n  + One undestands, seeks and appreaciates liberty\r\n  + One believes in the modern excess of government\r\n  + One is willing not to be complacent\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n  + As an early project, there might be unintended bias coming from early contributors. As it grows, we expect it to go away.\r\n  + This project is currently focused on the reality of western countries(and affected countries). If it doesn't reflect your reality, feel free to fork it and make changes. In order to build a community around it, we'd appreciate to reference it to Libertr.\r\n \r\n## Threats to Liberty\r\n\r\n### War on Privacy\r\n\r\n### Physical Wars\r\n\r\n### Gun Control\r\n\r\n### War on Drugs\r\n\r\n### Political Correctness\r\n\r\n## Finding Liberty\r\n\r\n### Substance\r\n\r\n### Hacking\r\n\r\n### Entrepreneurship\r\n\r\n### Politics\r\n\r\n## Related Projects\r\n\r\n### Internet\r\n  + [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)\r\n  + [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)\r\n  + [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/)\r\n  + [OpenBazaar](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar)\r\n  + [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/)\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n  + [The Seastanding Institute](http://www.seasteading.org/)\r\n  + [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/)\r\n\r\n### Media\r\n\r\n#### Movies\r\n  + [V for Vendetta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKvvOFIHs4k)\r\n  + [Dallas Buyers Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8utPuIFVnU)\r\n  + [Fight Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUXWAEX2jlg)\r\n  + [The Hunger Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S9a5V9ODuY)\r\n\r\n#### Books\r\n  + [1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)\r\n  + [Brave New World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)\r\n  +  [Fahrenheit 451](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451)\r\n  +  [Zero to One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One)\r\n  +  [Atlas Shrugged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged)\r\n  +  [The Fountainhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead)\r\n\r\n## Prominent Figures\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
